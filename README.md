ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub repository!

Discover all the RTL codes I've uploaded for each day on social media, along with practice files including simulation images. ðŸš€

Browse through the .v and _tb.v files to explore the code, and visualize the simulation results in the png/jpg files.

I hope these resources help you learn RTL codes and deepen your understanding. If you have any questions or find anything unclear, feel free to ask!
